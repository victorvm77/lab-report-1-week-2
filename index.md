## *Trying Some Commands*

* **To get use to the terminal, running couple commands, will help to get adjusted using the terminal**

* **As a example I ran the "pwd" and "cat" commands in the terminal**

*Using the “pwd” we are shown the path of the current directory and command “cp” copies a file and “cat” shows you what in the file*
